Instagram brand assets and guidelines

Welcome to Instagram’s brand resources site. Here you’ll find brand guidelines and downloadable assets as well as information on obtaining permission to use Instagram assets in your own work.
Brand guidelines and assets

Anyone using Instagram’s assets should only use the logos and screenshots found on our Brand Resource Center site and follow these guidelines.

Only those planning to use Instagram’s assets in any broadcast, radio, out-of-home advertising or print larger than 8.5 x 11 inches (A4 size) need to request permission. Requests must be in English and include a mock of how you’re planning to use the Instagram logo.

Be sure to visit the Brand Elements section (https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/instagram/icons/) for detailed guidelines and to download approved assets.
